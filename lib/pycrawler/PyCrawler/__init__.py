PyCrawler is python module that uses pycurl (libcurl) to provide a
high-throughput crawler that can scale to (probably) hundreds of
millions of pages and saturate large network pipes.  It implements
politeness and robots.txt checking, and provides a simple API for
creating your own content analyzers and link rankers for prioritizing
which links it follows.
