			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/files/2008/06/arianna-huffington.jpg" title="arianna-huffington.jpg"><img align="right" width="191" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/files/2008/06/arianna-huffington.jpg" height="264" /></a><em>Nationally syndicated columnist and Huffingtonpost.com co-founder/editor-in-chief <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington">Arianna Huffington</a> may not have been a personal supporter of <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2008/06/06/does-clinton-have-the-chemistry-with-obama-to-be-his-vp/">Hillary Clinton</a> for the Democratic party nomination (HuffPost didn't endorse a candidate), but she has kind words for the New York senator and former first lady all the same.</em></p>
<p><em>I met Arianna in New York on Tuesday to ask her what she, as the author of a book about women conquering their fears, thought about Clinton's failure to secure the nomination and her political future.</em></p>
<p><em>Here's what she said about...</em></p>
<p><strong>Supporting Obama:</strong></p>
<p>Since this is an election where we are clear that it's in the best interests of the country that (Arizona Republican Senator) John McCain is not president , and we have seen that Obama has a much better chance of defeating John McCain, it's a very clear choice. (With Obama) there's no equivocation. It's the future, getting out of Iraq. It's a dramatically different take on the economy. It's a clear break with the past, which the country's really longing for.</p>
<p><strong>Drawbacks to Clinton:</strong></p>
<p>The two main drawbacks were that she did vote to authorize the war, so it's much harder to oppose the war as categorically as Obama can oppose it, given that he has been against it from 2002... Given now that a vast majority of the American people know the war was wrong, if you knew that from the begining, you'd have a real clear advantage.</p>
<p><strong>On the disappointment of a woman not getting a major party nomination:</strong></p>
<p>Actually you know, I found her speech on Saturday so incredibly important for women because I have written as you know for my "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Fearless-Love-Work-Life/dp/0316166812">Fearless</a>" book a lot about how a lot of women have held (themselves) back because of the fear of failure. That has been the greatest fear in women. I mean, men have it too, but women, we have it in a much more intense way.</p>
<p>She failed in her immediate goal of winning the nomination, but this was in a way a historic triumph for women, because the question, "Can a woman be commander-in-chief?" will never be asked again. Can a woman run a great campaign, raise money and get millions of votes? All these questions have now been answered, thanks to her race. As a mother of two teenaged daughters, I'm constantly saying to them, always take the risk, go for your dreams. If you fail, it doesn't matter. It's like there is nobody who has succeeded in life who has not failed along the way. (Her speech) was a concession speech but at the same time it was a triumphant speech. I thought it was an incredibly moving, powerful moment for the country and especially for women.</p>
<p><em>And would she support Hillary in 2012 if she ran again, and the circumstances were right?</em></p>
<p>Sure. Absolutely.</p>
<p><em>I also asked why it should be that a woman in the United States still hasn't had a clear shot at becoming a head of state when countries like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi">India</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megawati_Sukarnoputri">Indonesia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel">Germany</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Bachelet">Chile </a>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto">Pakistan</a> have pulled it off.</em></p>
<p><strong>Her answer:</strong></p>
<p>It has more to do with the women who have run... I don't think there is more sexism here than there is in India, for example. If you look at the women who run, there isn't anyone you'd say, "yes, if that person wasn't a woman, they'd absolutely have to be president."</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ST. LOUIS - The doctor was in on Tuesday, as Democratic presidential candidate <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/barackobama">Barack Obama </a>made the rounds at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in the battleground state of Missouri with a cardiac nurse.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/rtx6hqp.jpg" title="rtx6hqp.jpg"><img align="left" width="300" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/rtx6hqp.jpg" alt="rtx6hqp.jpg" height="240" class="imageframe" /></a>Obama, hoping to highlight his health care proposal and show local voters a more personal side, visited patients, pushed a cart and conferred with nurses during a two-hour stint in the hospital&#8217;s cardiac unit.</p>
<p>His guide for the early-morning shift was nurse Kate Marzluf, 26, who good-naturedly answered his questions and tried to ignore a swarming media contingent while handing out medicine and checking on patients.</p>
<p>At one point, as the nurse filled him in on her tasks, Obama said it &#8220;makes me faint just to think about it. You&#8217;re not drawing any blood, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>During later check-ups, two patients reported sharply higher blood pressure than normal. Obama told the first patient he sympathized.</p>
<p>&#8220;When reporters are around me, my blood pressure goes up too,&#8221; he said, smiling. At the next stop, he was even more direct.</p>
<p>&#8220;The press has the same effect on me. They get my blood boiling,&#8221; Obama said. He smiled again.</p>
<p> Later, Obama praised Marzluf and the hospital staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is one thing that is right about health care in this country, it&#8217;s the extraordinary men and women who are entering the medical profession,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. President <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">George W. Bush </a>got polite applause Tuesday for his brief, pre-taped video address to the <a href="http://www.sbc.net/">Southern Baptist Convention,</a> America&#8217;s largest evangelical denomination, which is holding its annual meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/rtx6q3s.jpg" title="rtx6q3s.jpg"><img align="left" width="225" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/rtx6q3s.jpg" alt="rtx6q3s.jpg" height="300" class="imageframe" /></a>That stood in marked contrast to the standing ovations he received last year from the same group when he did a live broadcast link to its meeting in San Antonio.</p>
<p>This may have been because his remarks this year were pre-taped as opposed to being broadcast from the White House live, as they have been in previous years.</p>
<p>Still, the lukewarm response may also reflect a cooling of conservative evangelicals toward the Republican Party.</p>
<p>White evangelical Protestants did more than any other group to put Bush into the White House and there is a feeling among some that he did not pursue their anti-abortion and gay rights agenda with the vigor they had hoped for.</p>
<p>They are also cool towards presumptive Republican presidential nominee <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/johnmccain">John McCain. </a>Several <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed7/idUSN0935340120080610">interviewed by Reuters </a>saw him as the lesser of two liberals in the November White House matchup with his Democratic rival <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/barackobama">Barack Obama</a>.</p>
<p>Bush spoke the language of American evangelicals in his speech, praising them for defending &#8220;the sanctity of life&#8221; &#8212; which is code in such circles for opposing abortion rights. </p>
<p>If remarks like that don&#8217;t get this crowd riled up then McCain really has his work cut out for him.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON - Republican presidential candidate <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/johnmccain">John McCain </a>spent a marathon day raising money on Monday, and it went well: after events in Virginia and Washington, D.C., the campaign and the Republican Party pulled in more than $2 million.<br />
 <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/mccainface.jpg" title="mccainface.jpg"><img align="right" width="300" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/mccainface.jpg" alt="mccainface.jpg" height="202" class="imageframe" /></a><br />
&#8220;We won&#8217;t raise as much money as our opponent but we certainly will raise (a) sufficient amount of money to win this election,&#8221; the Arizona senator told a gathering at a Ritz Carlton hotel in Northern Virginia.<br />
 <br />
His opponent, of course, is Democrat <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/barackobama">Barack Obama</a>, who has consistently broken records with his fundraising in the primary contests.<br />
 <br />
McCain congratulated Obama on his victory over rival <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/hillaryclinton">Hillary Clinton </a>in the Democratic nominating battle but needled the Illinois senator for a lack of experience by saying the White House was not a place for on-the-job training.<br />
 <br />
McCain was certainly on the job bringing in cash. One event included tickets to a &#8220;victory dinner&#8221; and two receptions for a contribution &#8212; raised or donated &#8212; of $50,000. Whew.<br />
 <br />
And even those lobbyists out there got a thank-you.<br />
 <br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to thank some corrupt unscrupulous lobbyists that are destroying America as we speak, everything we stand for and believe in,&#8221; McCain joked at one fundraiser. <br />
 <br />
Right.<br />
 <br />
Finally, there was praise for his opponent-turned-supporter, former Massachusetts Gov. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN0716648220080207">Mitt Romney</a>.<br />
 <br />
&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody who represents me better today than Mitt Romney,&#8221; McCain said.<br />
 <br />
Are you listening, governor? That could be the sound of a vice presidential offer coming down the road &#8230;</p>

In an interview with ABC News, Bush said that Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/rtx6hp9.jpg" title="rtx6hp9.jpg"></a>February remark that she was proud of the United States &#8220;for the first time in my adult life&#8221; was misconstrued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she probably meant &#8216;I&#8217;m more proud.&#8217; That&#8217;s what she really meant,&#8221; Bush said from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to be really careful in what you say because everything you say is looked at and in many cases misconstrued,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Some commentators have said the remarks show that Obama, wife of likely Democratic Presidential nominee <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/johnedwards">Barack Obama</a>, does not love her country.</p>
<p>Bush also praised her White House predecessor, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/hillaryclinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, who formally ended her bid to be the first female president on Saturday.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/rtx6ob3.jpg" title="rtx6ob3.jpg"><img align="right" width="296" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/rtx6ob3.jpg" alt="rtx6ob3.jpg" height="300" class="imageframe" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Well of course, I want the woman president to be a Republican woman,&#8221; Bush said, when asked whether she was sorry to see Clinton&#8217;s campaign end.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I will say I watched the campaign and I admired Hillary&#8217;s grit and strength,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to say I had a lot of admiration for her endurance,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/rtx6ob3.jpg" title="rtx6ob3.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Bush, who has endured five political campaigns with her husband dating back to the 1970s, said she would not run for office herself.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/beck.jpg" title="beck.jpg"><img align="right" width="83" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/beck.thumbnail.jpg" alt="beck.jpg" height="150" class="imageframe" /></a>BERLIN - German political leaders almost never make endorsements in foreign elections, especially in the United States &#8212; which has been the country&#8217;s most important partner and ally in the six decades since World War Two.</p>
<p>Even when a German chancellor is having serious troubles with a U.S. president and can&#8217;t even get the POTUS to accept a transatlantic phone call &#8212; as was the case with Gerhard Schroeder in 2002 following his falling out with George W. Bush over the looming invasion of Iraq &#8212; they would rather say nothing at all than stray from that tacit but deeply entrenched post-war tradition of staying out of U.S. political campaigns.</p>
<p>So it was all the more surprising on Saturday when Schroeder&#8217;s successor as chairman of the center-left Social Democrats, Kurt Beck, opened his mouth and dove into the U.S. race with an unambiguous endorsement of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/barackobama">Barack Obama</a> (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL07732825">http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCr isis/idUSL07732825</a>).  It was simply unheard of. Beck wants to be chancellor in 2009.  His SPD is in a grand coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s Christian Democrats.   Abandoning that post-war neutrality is just not something that German leaders do, even if Beck&#8217;s SPD is the natural ally of Obama&#8217;s Democrats. No one in Schroeder&#8217;s administration would have even dreamed of endorsing Senator John Kerry in 2004 even though Schroeder was persona non-grata in Washington after his open and at-times ugly confrontation with Bush over the wisdom of invading Iraq. &#8220;There&#8217;s no way in hell you&#8217;re going to get me or anyone else to utter even one word against Bush,&#8221; is how one senior Schroeder foreign policy adviser put it to me in 2004 when I kept asking if they were not at least secretly hoping Bush might not be re-elected.  And before Schroeder, no one in conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl&#8217;s administration would have had any official opinion or comment on U.S. presidential races or candidates.</p>
<p>Christian Democrat Kohl, in fact, got on extremely well with Democrat Bill Clinton even though the CDU&#8217;s natural ally in the United States would be the Republicans. Kohl went about as far as any German leader would dare go, as far as I&#8217;ve seen, in &#8220;intervening&#8221; in a U.S. race. But his &#8220;intervention&#8221; was simply meeting Clinton in Wisconsin, rather than in Washington, at a so-called &#8220;bratwurst summit&#8221; in May 1996, held in that state in part because the German-American stronghold was expected to be a key battleground in the November 1996 campaign. </p>

Try-outs for the number two spot on the presumptive Republican nominee&#8217;s presidential ticket continued this week as the Arizona senator made stops in two states with governors who appear to be on his short list.</p>
<p>In Louisiana, it was Bobby Jindal, the state&#8217;s popular 36-year-old governor who is considered a rising star in the party. Jindal, who stood next to the Arizona senator at a press conference and revved up the crowds before events, said the right things and appeared to crave the microphone as much as the man who could make his career.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody can make promises on reform. It takes a person with conviction to actually achieve reform,&#8221; Jindal told an audience in Baton Rouge on Wednesday, contrasting the Arizona senator with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/barackobama">Barack Obama</a>, his Democratic rival who has made &#8220;change&#8221; his rallying cry.</p>
<p>Good start, governor.</p>
<p>In Florida it was Charlie Crist, another popular governor who reigns in a &#8220;swing state&#8221; that could be critical in November&#8217;s general election.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m privileged and honored to be here with Sen. McCain,&#8221; Crist said on Friday after joining McCain and his entourage on a boat tour of the marshy Everglades.</p>
<p>Some have called into question McCain&#8217;s support of the subtropical wilderness area after he opposed a bill that would have given it additional funds. McCain says he opposed the measure because of other &#8220;pork barrel&#8221; spending projects that were tagged on.</p>
<p>Crist, like a good right-hand man, said this to reporters:</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the senator took the time and the trouble to be here and to see it personally &#8230; means an awful lot about where his heart is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmm &#8230; but where is his heart when it comes to choosing his number two? McCain, who usually likes chatting with the press, is not saying.</p>

<p>CHICAGO - An influential supporter of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/barackobama">Barack Obama </a>said <a href="http://www.resuters.com/news/globalcoverage/hillaryclinton">Hillary Clinton </a>has the experience to be the Illinois senator&#8217;s running mate, but questioned whether the pair had the right chemistry.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has the qualities to do it: experience, the millions of votes she got, her political strength,&#8221; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson told El Pais, Spain&#8217;s main daily newspaper.</p>
<p>Richardson, who has also been mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, added, &#8220;it&#8217;s important that the president and the vice president have a personal chemistry to work together, and I don&#8217;t know, after these divisive primaries, if there is that chemistry between them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grueling 16-month struggle for the Democratic nomination came to an end on Tuesday when Obama captured the number of delegates needed to become the nominee.</p>
<p>The battle was marked by sometimes sharp attacks, such as when Clinton ran an ad this spring raising doubts about whether Obama had the experience needed to answer a 3 a.m. crisis phone call in the White House. Obama responded by saying Clinton&#8217;s vote to authorize the Iraq war undercut her own argument about experience.</p>
<p>At times, in their debates, the tension between Obama, an Illinois senator, and Clinton, a New York senator, was palpable, although they both referred to one another as friends.</p>
<p>Clinton did not concede the race to Obama right away, but has since announced an event on Saturday where she will formally back him. The two met in Washington on Thursday night, in a gathering that had an aura of intrigue after Obama slipped away from his traveling press corps to visit with her.</p>
<p>Rchardson knows better than most how bitter the Democratic presidential race became.</p>
<p>The governor, who also ran for president but dropped out earlier in the primaries, has described a tense phone call he had with Clinton when he told her he was throwing his support to Obama.</p>
<p>Clinton supporter James Carville publicly called Richardson a &#8220;Judas,&#8221; suggesting he was disloyal for not supporting the former first lady. Richardson was a senior official in former President Bill Clinton&#8217;s administration.</p>
<p>Richardson, a Latino who has been helping Obama court Hispanic voters, is often mentioned as a possible running mate for Obama. He is a former energy secretary and former ambassador to the United Nations who would bring foreign policy experience to the ticket.</p>
<p>Richardson said he is not pushing for the vice presidential job, though he &#8220;would consider it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very happy in New Mexico and I&#8217;m not going to do any lobbying or asking for positions,&#8221; he said.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. - It&#8217;s June. The U.S. presidential  election is in November. So does it pay to be the front-runner now &#8212; or the underdog?<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/mccain7.jpg" title="mccain7.jpg"><img align="right" width="180" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/files/2008/06/mccain7.jpg" alt="mccain7.jpg" height="121" class="imageframe" /></a></p>
<p>Republican John <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/johnmccain">McCain </a>has gone with underdog, declaring himself just that in an interview with ABC News&#8217; Charles Gibson on Thursday, two days after Illinois Sen. Barack <a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/barackobama">Obama </a>became the presumptive Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the underdog?&#8221; Gibson asked, according to a transcript of the interview.<br />
&#8220;Oh, yes, I think so. I think so,&#8221; McCain replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think &#8212; I&#8217;m surprised, frankly, to see the polls as close as they are, given our brand problems in the Republican Party. I&#8217;m pleased where we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t want to be the favorite.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/news/globalcoverage/hillaryclinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, who is set to end her campaign for the Democratic nomination this week, was the clear front-runner last year before she lost to Obama in January in Iowa, the first state to hold a nominating contest.</p>
<p>McCain does have some obstacles. He has to compete with the historic nature of his opponent&#8217;s bid &#8212; Obama would be the first black U.S. president &#8212; and the unpopular Republican president, <a href="http://www/whitehouse.gov">George W. Bush</a>, whom both hope to succeed.</p>
<p>McCain played down the role of race at an event in Florida and is already working to gather some of the attention that has been showered on his Democratic rivals &#8212; and to find a style that suits him.</p>
<p>After his speech on Tuesday night was panned for poor delivery, the Arizona senator ditched his teleprompter on Thursday and spoke from the cuff, looking more natural and more comfortable.</p>
