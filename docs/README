nose-coverage-parallel is a nose patch for the coverage plugin to enable
parallel coverage, so that nosetests we run get proper coverage information.

The patch was developed for nose 0.11.3, but works with nose 0.11.1 and
likely works with other similar versions, as it only changes the coverage
plugin.

 In nose source directory (download source from 
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose), run 

   patch -p1 < /path/to/pycrawler/docs/nose-coverage-parallel.diff
   setup.py install

And you will now have a patched nose.

Also, we require a post-3.3.1 version of coverage that hasn't yet been
released.
