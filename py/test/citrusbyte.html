Ruby TMTOWTDI, Episode 1
This series however aims to use this property of Ruby as an educational tool.
This is not meant to be a golfing competition nor an optimization one.
However we will benchmark the solutions for a rough idea on how different styles affect performance.
Leave a comment with your solution if you think you can best the ones listed here.
We also encourage you to propose a simple problem (less than 0 lines of code to solve) for the next instalment in the series.
Note that the values of this hash are integers not strings.
Leaving some spoiler space in case you want to try it on your own.
Below are selected solutions from our team.
Lots of interesting styles here.
Meanwhile Nicolas is the performance winner by a mile coming in more than 0% faster than the nearest competitor.
It	transmits intent better in a way.
You look at that and the entire code sequence is a Hash construction plain and simple even if you ignore the subexpression in the middle you know the outcome.
Bah just something that responds to #to_a.
Hm actually depends on what intent is better to show.
This is what I'd do takes less than 0.
Actually seeing all the solutions my regexp is horrible :P I should've used \w instead of \D.
And besides that's even faster.
The benchmark in my computer for my original solution reports 7.
Oh and Michel's fastest solution (first comment) times at 4.
However the script went from 0.
Yeah the point of requiring integers was to make it a slightly more involving problem.
Requiring integers would entail more variations of answers since you'd need a way of iterating for the to_i.
Personally I had never used the Enumerable#each_slice method before.
This is especially interesting looking into the dark art of creating hashes using blocks.
Which clocked in around 1 secs on my machine.
It seems that forcing the types might help the compiler instead of making it choose.
But when the letter is first that's not the case which means that there still needs to be some sort of parsing rather than a v.
Again maybe I'm wrong about that.
Whoops I hadn't read all of the comments yet when I submitted my post.
The first system is a AMD Athlon XP 400+ with .
The second system is an Intel Xeon 5130 @ .
GHz with GB of RAM running "FreeBSD 7.
Linux while mine is faster than his on 64-bit FreeBSD.
Something strange I noticed was the parentheses around two of the block parameters in Nick's solution.
The parentheses are there to unpack the second item into (k v) instead of having to split it inside I didn't know it would give an improvement on performance.
