Gallery: The iPhone 2.0 Keynote
SAN FRANCISCO -- As conferences go Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference ranks low on the sexiness factor.
Phone 3G the programmer-centric conference would not have drawn the hundreds of broadcast print and blog journalists that it did.
Fortunately Apple CEO Steve Jobs did have a new iPhone up his sleeve and after spending an hour selling the company's new iPhone development tools and previewing some of the platform's forthcoming apps Jobs delivered what we all came for: the new phone.
GB version $300 for a 16-GB version.
Both will be available in a new slightly rounded case with a shiny black-plastic back.
GB version will also be available with a white back.
Breaking with Jobs' keynote tradition the iPhone 3G is not yet available: Both models will go on sale July 11 in countries.
Apple plans to make the phone available in 75 countries within several months.
Indeed Jobs -- looking thinner than ever in his trademark black mock-turtleneck -- let his deputies take most of the stage time.
More than one audience member noticed that Jobs seemed to be looking a little wan and have less energy than usual.
This one was looking a little gray not to mention baggy.
