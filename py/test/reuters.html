Google says it would support U.S. privacy law
Google Inc has told a senior Republican lawmaker concerned about privacy that the Internet search and advertising company supports a federal privacy law.
Privacy advocates object to the amount of information that Google Yahoo and other online companies collect about users.
Google in particular has been under pressure to post a link on its home page to its privacy policy.
Joe Barton the senior Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee wrote to Google in May asking for details about the search engine's privacy practices since it acquired competitor DoubleClick.
Google told Barton in a letter dated June 6 that it would support creation of a federal Internet privacy law.
It was signed by Alan Davidson Google's chief lobbyist.
Chief Executive Eric Schmidt and Barton met last November and two of Barton's aides went to Google headquarters in Mountain View California in December to discuss privacy.
Marc Rotenberg executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center was skeptical of Google's endorsement of a federal privacy law.
Rotenberg said that when companies push for a "comprehensive" law they often want something that would preempt more stringent state laws.
Rotenberg citing California and New York as examples of states with tough privacy laws.
